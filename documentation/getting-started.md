# Getting started
> Disclaimer: This project is currently a "It works on my system". This page is a first draft for a getting started with no guarantees to be complete or anything.

You will need:
* Apache2 + PHP 7.4 or higher (check with phpinfo.php)
* MySQL Server like mariadb
* phpmyadmin is a good idea

Clone this repo into `/var/www/html/Taskmanager` and use `j_tasks.sql` to setup your database.

To connect the _Taskmanager_ to your DB, create the file `includes/credentials.php` (based on the sample config in the same folder).

After that you should be able to use this project. Please keep in mind that this is still in heavy development!

If you want more information, you can also contact me through the information you find on my github profile.
